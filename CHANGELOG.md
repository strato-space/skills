# Changelog

## 2026-01-22

### PROBLEM SOLVED

- Session outcomes were not documented in this repo, reducing traceability; captured the dialog summary in docs.

### FEATURE IMPLEMENTED
- Added `docs/agents-and-skills-summary.md` with definitions and practical guidance.
- Added `docs/dialog-summary-2026-01-21.md` to summarize recent work on the close-session skill.

### CHANGES
- Added `AGENTS.md` to document repo scope and update expectations.
- Added `CHANGELOG.md` with required sections and date structure.
- Updated `README.md` to link local docs.
- Added `docs/` directory and its documentation files.
